# BabylonDreams modo Pipeline

The BabylonDreams modo Pipeline kit contains scripts, configs and functions to make working in modo smoother.

It is pretty much hard coded for our internal pipeline at the moment and very much in flux. But it may contain a few useful functions or ways of doing things. Feel free to adapt or improve upon my work.

## Disclaimer

I am not a trained programmer and I usually don't have much time to code. So be prepared for ugly code, quick hacks and stuff that is half finished. You have been warned.
