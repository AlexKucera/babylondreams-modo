Welcome to BabylonDreams modo Pipeline Kit's documentation!
===========================================================

The BabylonDreams modo Pipeline kit contains scripts, configs and functions to make working in modo smoother.

It relies on bd_pipeline_, our pipeline wide connective glue library. Please see the `bd_pipline documentation`_ for more details.
